Overall coupon acceptance rate was 56% which seems pretty high, however the acceptance rate for the bar was significantly lower at 41%.  The key groups that seemed to respond to the coupons were driver out with adult friends and drivers that had indicators of some disposable income.  The coupons also seemd to do better wiht the <30 demographic.  Coupon take rate was highest in the evening, but also in the opposite direction of travel, indicting drivers migth be interested in hitting the bar after completing some errand.  Given the social nature of the interested drivers (younger driver, ones out with adult friends) it migth make sense to focus on that with buy-one-get-one type offers.
